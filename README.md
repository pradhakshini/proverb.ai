# 🧠 Proverb.AI

A lightweight AI project that analyzes text and generates insightful interpretations or proverb‑style summaries using natural language processing and language models.

> Turn everyday text into proverb‑style wisdom with AI! 💡

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Proverb.AI** is a Jupyter Notebook‑based AI experiment that uses pretrained language models to produce proverb‑like outputs or distilled wisdom from input text.  
This can be used for creative writing, insights generation, or educational purposes.

## 📗 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pradhakshini/proverb.ai.git
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook proverb.ipynb
    ```
3. Install requirements if prompted (example):
    ```bash
    pip install transformers torch
    ```
4. Run cells to generate proverb‑style outputs.

> **Note:** Some cells may require internet or a local model depending on implementation.
